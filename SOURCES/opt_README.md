# IMPORTANT

This directory should either contain a soft link to each file listed in `/usr/share/aps/dts/cert` **or** a certificate/key combination used for the nginx server, as well as the http gateway.
Please take a look at the http frontend documentation for how to update those certificates with proper ones.
